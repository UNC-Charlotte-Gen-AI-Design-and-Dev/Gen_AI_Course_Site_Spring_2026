The University of North Carolina at Charlotte's College of Computing and Informatics (CCI) is part of a dynamic and exciting educational and research
institution that combines the knowledge and expertise of multidisciplinary faculty, industry professionals, and students. The CCI was formed in 2000 as the
College of Information Technology, with the mission of educating information technology specialists, conducting leading-edge research, and partnering with
area businesses of great importance to the Charlotte community and the University. It was renamed the College of Computing and Informatics in 2006 in an
effort to reflect the College’s commitment to maintain relevancy with the ever-changing world of information technology that impacts all of our lives on a
daily basis.
The College of Computing and Informatics consists of three departments:
• Department of Bioinformatics and Genomics
• Department of Computer Science
• Department of Software and Information Systems
Plus one interdisciplinary school:
• School of Data Science
The primary mission of CCI includes:
• Cultivating an inclusive culture dedicated to student success and equity in education
• Stimulating innovative high-risk high-impact research and development
• Maintaining a resilient and ethical society of educated, caring citizens
Degree Programs
With educational programs rooted in a strong foundation of research, the CCI combines the talents of on- and off-campus partners in achieving its mission.
Academic programs include Bachelor's, Master's, and Ph.D. degree programs in computer science, information technology, data science, and bioinformatics
and computational biology. Committed to the concept of life-long learning, the College also offers undergraduate and graduate certificate programs.
The College offers a single entry to the Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, with the curriculum for specific
concentrations in the Departments of Computer Science, Software and Information Systems, and Bioinformatics and Genomics.
A key component of all CCI academic programs is the team interaction between students, faculty, and community partners. Through their involvement in
real-world projects, students apply what they learn, thus, giving them practical experience as they help businesses solve computing and informatics
challenges.
Majors
Within the College of Computing and Informatics, the requirements of the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) and Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Computer Science are
fulfilled by completing specific concentrations of courses offered by the three different departments in the College of Computing and Informatics and
designed for students interested in pursuing a career in computing.
The B.S. offers a broad core of computing subjects and allows in-depth study in one of these concentrations:
• AI, Robotics, and Gaming (Department of Computer Science)
• Bioinformatics (Department of Bioinformatics and Genomics)
• Cybersecurity (Department of Software and Information Systems)
• Data Science (Department of Computer Science)
• Software Engineering (Department of Software and Information Systems)
• Software, Systems, and Networks (Department of Computer Science)
• Web and Mobile Applications (Department of Software and Information Systems)
The B.A. program is designed for students interested in pursuing a career in one of the following concentrations:
• Bioinformatics (Department of Bioinformatics and Genomics)
• Human-Computer Interaction (Department of Software and Information Systems)
• Information Technology (Department of Software and Information Systems)

Honors Program
The Computing and Informatics Honors Program (CCI Honors) is a research-based experience designed to provide mentoring to high-achieving students to
better prepare them for post-graduate success. CCI Honors students must complete a capstone research project under the supervision of a faculty
member. Upon the successful completion of the honors program in CCI, students receive Honors commendations on their transcript and in the
commencement program.
Admission Requirements
Consideration for admission to the honors program may be initiated by the student or by any faculty member in the College of Computing and Informatics
(CCI). To qualify, students must have:
• An overall GPA of 3.2
• A GPA of 3.4 in CCI courses
Students should apply in the semester prior to the semester they plan to graduate. The CCI Honors Committee will formally approve admission.
Course Requirements
ITSC 4750 - Honors Thesis (3)
Certification Requirements
To graduate with Honors in Computing and Informatics, students must:
• Prepare a description of the proposed honors research for submission to the CCI Honors Committee, which has the authority to approve, recommend
revisions to, or reject the proposal. Students who plan to graduate with "Honors in Computing and Informatics" must complete the Application to
Candidacy process for graduating with honors, as directed by the Honors College, beginning in the semester prior to registering for ITSC 4750.
• Complete 3 credit hours of Honors Thesis (ITSC 4750) during the semester in which the student will complete their project.
• Prepare a written honors thesis based upon independent honors research.
• Make a public presentation of the research results and successfully defend their thesis before the student's honors committee.
• Receive a grade of A in ITSC 4750, have a GPA of at least 3.4 for courses in CCI, and an overall GPA of 3.2.
Upon completing the requirements of the honors program, receiving the recommendation of the College of Computing and Informatics Honors Committee
and upon certification by the Honors College, the CCI Honors candidate shall graduate with Honors in Computing and Informatics.
