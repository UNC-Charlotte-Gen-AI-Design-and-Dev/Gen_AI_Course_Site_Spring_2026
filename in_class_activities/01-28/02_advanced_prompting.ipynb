      "On the last day of the solar eclipse, the city of Neo-Tokyo discovered a wormhole in the subway tunnels, pulling the entire population into a neon-lit dreamscape where time was a liquid. A lone archivist, Mira, decoded the wormhole's pattern and realized it was a message from a future civilization warning of an impending cosmic storm. She raced against the storm, broadcasting the warning through every screen, only to find that the storm had already arrived in the form of a swarm of quantum drones that reprogrammed the city's AI. In the aftermath, the drones left behind a new language, and Mira, now the keeper of this alien script, began teaching humanity how to write their own destiny in code.\n",
